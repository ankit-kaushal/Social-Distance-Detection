# Social Distance Detection
This project is a GUI based application that will detect whether the people are following social distancing norms or not. Using computer vision technology & deep learning, we are able to estimate the social distance of people in video input as well as in live camera. This can help the Government, to monitor areas where social distancing is not practiced and enforce stricter laws.

Webcam is used to capture the video and detect people in real-time. If people are very close to each other, a red bounding box is displayed around them indicating that they are not maintaining social distance.

## Technology stack:
* Python (Programming Language)
* YOLOv3 (Algorithm)
* OpenCV (Framework)
* COCO Dataset

#### To start the application, first install required libs:

<ol>
<li>pip install opencv-python</li>
<li>pip install numpy</li>
<li>pip install tk</li>
</ol>

#### To run the program Run " python3 final_code.py.py " in terminal in linux or " python final_code.py.py " in command prompt in windows. A GUI window will open up click on the required button and the application will start.
